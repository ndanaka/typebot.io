# Link to typebot

The typebot link logic block allows you to go into another typebot flow. This ultimately helps keep your flows clean and be able to reuse a flow in multiple places.

  alt="Link to typebot logic block"

Variables are shared by default, you just need them to make sure they are present in the variables dropdown on both flows.
