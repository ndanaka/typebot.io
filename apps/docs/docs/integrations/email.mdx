# Email

If you want to receive an email notification each time a user completes the bot or if you want to send a recap to the user, the Email block is made for you:

<img src="/img/integrations/email.png" width="400" alt="Email block example" />

By default, the email will be sent from notifications@typebot.io with a default content based on what your new lead has replied. It will look like this:

<img src="/img/integrations/default-email.png" alt="Email block example" />

You can choose to use your own email (SMTP) account, using the "From:" dropdown and filling in your credentials.
You can also customize the email content with your own text/HTML.
