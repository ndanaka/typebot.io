# FAQ

## Why some of my results are empty?

Your typebot collects results as soon as your user answers the first input. If other inputs have a blank answer, it means the user never answered them and left the bot.

## How can I delete a block or an edge?

You can right-click on most elements in the graph to open up a contextual menu.

## Is human takeover is available on Typebot?

Live chat is not natively integrated. Typebot is specifically built for async chats. You can still have a human takeover feature using the [Chatwoot block](/editor/blocks/integrations/chatwoot). It will open a Chatwoot live chat box whenever the block is hit.

You can also implement great customer support with Typebot by using a ticketing system such as [Freshdesk](https://freshdesk.com/) or [Zendesk](https://www.zendesk.com/). You can create a ticket each time your user answers the bot.
