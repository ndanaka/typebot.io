## New article guidelines

- The article should be related to chatbots, or Typebot.
- The article should be written in English.
- The article should be original content. No plagiarism.
- The article should not be 100% AI-generated.

The mdx file should always start with the following frontmatter:

```md
---
title: 'My awesome blog post'
publishedAt: '2023-11-19'
summary: 'A short summary of the blog post.'
---
```

By default the og image is generated from the title of the blog post. If you want to use a custom og image, you can specify a `image` field in the frontmatter.
