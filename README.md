Typebot is an open-source alternative to Landbot. It allows you to create conversational apps (Lead qualification, Product launch, User onboarding, Customer support), embed them anywhere on your web apps, and collect results in real-time.

## Getting started with Typebot

The easiest way to get started with Typebot is with [the official managed service in the Cloud](https://app.typebot.io). It takes 1 minute to try out the builder for free. You'll have high availability, backups, security, and maintenance all managed for you by me, @baptisteArno, Typebot's founder.

That's also the best way to support my work, open-source software, and you'll get great service!
